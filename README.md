## Threading ##

### Coding ###
1. Use Java Thread/Runnables to calculate pi to 12 digits.
2. Use AsyncTask to sort an array of 1000 randomly generated numbers.
3. Use a looper to calculate the Fibonacci sequence unto the 20th iteration.
4. Create a small Sqlite database and use a loader to perform any crud operations from the database (You can have as many fields as you want, just make sure to use the loaders for any crud operations).

### Research ###
1. <b>What are loaders and how do we implement loaders?</b>
2. <b>What is an AsyncTaskLoader?</b>
3. <b>What is a Handler Thread for?</b>
4. <b>What are some common threading restrictions in android?</b>
5. <b>What are thread pools and thread pool executors?</b>
